# finance_analysis
Created different Profit and loss reports to evaluate financial performance and support decision-making.
By using Different SQL Queries, I created different reports like Gross monthly total sales report, Percentage contribution
of net sales per region report and report for top products in all division.
Used Power Query in Excel for data cleaning, removing spaces, duplicates, and blanks with clear messaging. Condensed a 500,000-row dataset into an intuitive dashboard, enabling efficient decision-making for the management.
Transformed unwieldy data into a user-friendly dashboard, saving management time and facilitating informed decision
making.
